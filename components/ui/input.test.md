# Luxe UI Input Component - Migration Complete

## Overview
Successfully migrated from basic shadcn Input to animated Luxe-style Input component with smooth animations and enhanced UX.

## New Features

### 1. Smooth Focus Animations
- **Border animation**: Animated gradient border appears at bottom on focus
- **Ring animation**: Smooth ring effect with 300ms transition
- **Shadow effects**: Subtle shadow transitions on hover and focus

### 2. Placeholder Animations
- Placeholder text slides slightly right and becomes more transparent on focus
- Smooth 300ms transition for professional feel

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- Hover state: Border color changes and subtle shadow appears
- Focus state: Ring effect with gradient border indicator
- Disabled state: Reduced opacity with proper cursor handling
- Invalid state: Red border and ring for form validation

### 4. Smooth Transitions
- All state changes use 300ms ease-in-out transitions
- Border, shadow, and transform animations are synchronized
- Maintains accessibility while adding visual polish

## Component Changes

### Before (Basic shadcn)
```tsx
<input
  type={type}
  className="border rounded-md px-3 py-1 ..."
  {...props}
/>
```

### After (Luxe-style animated)
```tsx
<div className="relative w-full">
  <input
    className="... transition-all duration-300 ..."
    onFocus={handleFocus}
    onBlur={handleBlur}
    {...props}
  />
  <div className="animated-border-indicator" />
</div>
```
